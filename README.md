 The StringUtils module is a collection of functions for manipulating strings. It includes functions for trimming whitespace from both ends of a string, converting a string to uppercase or lowercase, counting the number of characters in a string, replacing all occurrences of a substring in a string with another substring, extracting a substring from a string, and padding a string with a specified character to a specified length.
